## JSON for sendUserFeedback

Mandatory Keys:

- userID : of type _String_, maximum length **256 bytes**. It is generated by the origin server and MUST NOT be null or empty; discussed in a [later section](#generating-the-userid).
- overall: of type _Integer_, MUST be a value between 1-5. Typically the scores correspond to the [mean opinion score](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean_opinion_score), in this case this value represents the overall quality perceived by the userID.

Optional Keys:

- audio, video, screen: similar to the definition of `overall`, except these values correspond to specific types of media streams.
