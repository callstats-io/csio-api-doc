## callstats.initialize() 

- Authenticates with the callstats.io backend to setup a trusted relationship with it.
  
  Params  |  Argument | Type | Description
-----------  | ----------- | -------- | ---------- 
`AppID`  | Required | String | Application ID is obtained from callstats.io.
`AppSecret`  | Required | String | Application secret is obtained from callstats.io.
`localUserID`  | Required | String (256 bytes) | it is provided by the developer and MUST NOT be null or empty.
`initCallback`  | Optional | callback | asynchronously reports failure or success of the protocol messages.
`statsCallback`  | Optional | callback | asynchronously reports the conference statistics.  
`configParams`  | Optional | JSON| it is the set of parameters to enable/disable certain features in the library. 

Section on [generating userID](#generating-userid-and-conferenceid) provides more guidelines on choosing a `localUserID`.

### JSON for configParams

```javascript
var configParams = {
  disableBeforeUnloadHandler: true, // disables callstats.js's window.onbeforeunload parameter.
  applicationVersion: "app_version" // Application version specified by the developer.
};
```

It provides developers a method to enable or disable certain features or functions within the `callstats.js` library. It is a javascript object with the following OPTIONAL key-value pairs. They are:

  Keys  |  Required | Description
-----------  | -------- | ---------- 
`disableBeforeUnloadHandler` | No | by default the valus is `false`, See more details on `fabricTerminated` [event](#step-5-optional-conference-events).
`applicationVersion` | No | String of maximum length **30 characters**. 

<aside class="error">
Setting `disableBeforeUnloadHandler` to `true` disengages callstats.js's `window.onbeforeunload` handler, and you will need to send the fabricTerminated event for each active peerconnection. 
</aside>


## callstats.addNewFabric()
- Indicates that the WebRTC application intends to monitor the performance of the _PeerConnection_ between the two endpoints (represented by the corresponding UserIDs).
  
   Params  |  Argument | Type | Description
-----------  | ----------- | -------- | ---------- 
`pcObject`  | Required  |  Object | pass the _PeerConnection_ object created after invoking `RTCPeerConnection()`.
`remoteUserID`  |  Required  | String (256 bytes)| It is generated by the origin server.
`fabricUsage`  |  Required  | Enum | with valid values values discussed in a later section.
`conferenceID`   | Required  | String (512 bytes) | It is generated by the origin server. 
`pcCallback`  | Optional  | callback | the callback asynchronously reports failure or success. 

## callstats.reportError()
- Notifies the callstats.io backend about conference setup failure associated with reason.

   Params  |  Argument | Type | Description
-----------  | ----------- | -------- | ---------- 
`pcObject`  |  Required | Object | SHOULD pass the _PeerConnection_ object on which the failure occurred, however it MAY be set to null when passing in errors that occur when _getUserMedia()_ is called.
`conferenceID`  |  Required | String (512 bytes)| It is generated by the origin server.
`wrtcFuncName`  |  Required | Enum | where the failure occurred.
`domError`  |  Required | Object | pass the DOMError object received in the callback associated with the WebRTC API/function.
`localSDP`  |  Optional  |Object| pass the local SDP when errors occur before or during setLocalDescription() is executed. It MAY be set to NULL, in case you do not want SDPs to be collected.
`remoteSDP`  |  Optional  | Object | pass the remote SDP when errors occur during `createAnswer()`. It MAY be set to NULL, in case you do not want SDPs to be collected.

## callstats.associateMstWithUserID()
- Maps the SSRCs to a userID when multiple _MediaStreamTracks_ (MSTs) are sent or received in a single _PeerConnection_.
 
   Params  |  Argument | Type | Description
-----------  | ----------- | -------- | ---------- 
`pcObject`  | Required  | Object | pass the _PeerConnection_ object on which the _MediaStreamTracks_ are being sent.
`userID`  | Required  | String (256 bytes) | It is generated by the origin server.
`conferenceID`  | Required | String (512 bytes)| It is generated by the origin server.
`ssrc`  | Required | Object |Synchronization Source Identifier, as defined in [RFC3550](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3550). It is typically generated by the user-agent and MUST not be null or empty.
`usageLabel`  | Required | String (20 bytes) |it is generated by the origin server. For example, it can be set to `front-camera`, `back-camera`, `screen`, `audio-in`, `mic`, `system-sound`, enumeration-of-wrtcfuncname.
`associatedVideoTag`  | Optional | String | providing the associated `video tag id` attribute value.

## callstats.sendFabricEvent()
- Notifies the callstats.io backend about events (e.g., 'Hold', 'Mute', etc.) on a _PeerConnection_. It is usually generated due to local user interaction at a _PeerConnection_.

   Params  |  Argument | Type | Description
-----------  | ----------- | -------- | ---------- 
`pcObject`  | Required| Object | pass the _PeerConnection_ object associated with the _fabricEvent_.
`fabricEvent`  | Required | Enum| with valid values discussed in a later section.
`conferenceID` | Required| String (512 bytes) | It is generated by the origin server.

## callstats.sendUserFeedback()

- Send the feedback indicated by the user for a specific conferenceID.

   Params  |  Argument | Type | Description
-----------  | ----------- | -------- | ---------- 
`conferenceID`  | Required | String (512 bytes)| It is generated by the origin server.
`feedback`  | Required | Object| is a JSON object.
`pcCallback`  | Optional | callback | the callback asynchronously reports failure or success. 



### JSON for `feedback`

  Keys  |  Required | Type | Description
-----------  | -------- | -------- |----------
`userID` |  Required | String (256 bytes) | It is generated by the origin server. Discussed in a [later section](#generating-userid-and-conferenceid).
`overall` | Required | Integer (between 1-5) | Typically the scores correspond to the [mean opinion score](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean_opinion_score), in this case this value represents the overall quality perceived by the userID.
`audio, video, screen` | Optional | String | similar to the definition of `overall`, except these values correspond to specific types of media streams.
